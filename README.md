# Composes

A collection of my privately used container compose files.

Check out the [DNS](DNS.md) settings to manually set the right url's again.
And run the `./reboot-all.sh` file after doing `chmod +x reboot-all.sh` to make the file runable.
This will (remove if still there) and setup all the containers used in this repo.
